# mern-template

A template repository for a MongoDB - Express - React (w/ Redux) - Node project.

## Unsolicited advice
I'd heavily recommend working through building a similar repo for yourself from scratch, rather than blindly using this template to ensure that you know how it all interacts and what each line of code/config is doing.

## CAVEATS
1. This is using syntax from an older version of react.
2. This has not had any real testing, there are and will be errors.
3. This repo may be under active development and in a broken state at any point in time.
